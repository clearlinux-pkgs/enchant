2.3.3 (April 16, 2022)
----------------------

Update Nuspell provider, requiring Nuspell 5.1.0. The new provider takes
advantage of recently-added Nuspell APIs to be smaller and simpler.

Fix the C++ API is_added() method to return a boolean rather than void.

Require C99 and POSIX 2008, and as a result use fewer gnulib modules,
which gives a modest build time reduction.


2.3.2 (November 16, 2021)
-------------------------

Fix the generation of man pages, so that installation-dependent paths are
correctly inserted.

Improve error reporting when enchant-lsmod cannot open a dictionary for a
given language, in particular with the Aspell backend.

Fix compilation on MingW.

Some minor code cleanup.


2.3.1 (August 9, 2021)
----------------------

Hunspell: fix enchant_dict_get_extra_word_characters API so it always
returns UTF-8. Use the same limit on word length as Hunspell uses (it is
different for UTF-8). Drop support for Hunspell 1.4.

Ignore hidden files when loading provider modules.

In a slight update to a change introduced in 2.3.0, in the default
enchant.ordering file, do not prefer aspell for all “en” locales, only for
the specific “en” locales that it supports.


2.3.0 (June 14, 2021)
---------------------

Add -p flag to enchant.

Allow personal wordlist APIs (enchant_pwl_*) to take -1 as the length of the
word, as the enchant_dict_* APIs already allowed.

Add documentation to enchant_provider.h.

Make Aspell the default backend for English locales it supports, as it is
much quicker than Hunspell in this case and achieves slightly better
results.

Require nuspell version 4.1.0 or later.


2.2.15 (December 22, 2020)
--------------------------

Specify that nuspell >= 4.1.0 is required.

Fix some space leaks in the tests.


2.2.14 (December 10, 2020)
--------------------------

Improve installation instructions: in particular, add a note about where to
find them to README.

The nuspell backend is updated for newer versions.


2.2.13 (November 2, 2020)
-------------------------

Make the enchant program output its version to standard output, not standard
error. This may help some programs that use this output.


2.2.12 (October 15, 2020)
-------------------------

Fix a bug in the Voikko and Zemberek back-ends that could cause spell
checking and suggestion to fail. (For programmers: enchant_dict_check and
enchant_dict_suggest allow counted strings, but those two backends were
assuming the strings were NUL-terminated.)


2.2.11 (September 7, 2020)
--------------------------

Make enchant silently ignore -B flag, for better Emacs compatibility.

Make enchant_broker_list_dicts sort the tags, so that enchant-lsmod’s output
is sorted.

Minor build system improvement: don’t use -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE, which can cause
problems on Windows, and should be configured by the compiler vendor if
desired.


2.2.10 (September 1, 2020)
--------------------------

Fix Hunspell backend to treat apostrophes as Hunspell does: if either
straight or curly apostrophe is a word character, allow both.


2.2.9 (July 29, 2020)
---------------------

Fix a couple of space leaks in the Nuspell back end (thanks, ASAN).


2.2.8 (February 27, 2020)
-------------------------

Add a provider back-end for Nuspell (thanks, Sander van Geloven). Nuspell is
a new spell-checker whose development has been supported by the Mozilla
foundation. It is backwards-compatible with Hunspell and Myspell
dictionaries, while supporting a wider range of language peculiarities,
improved suggestions, and easier maintainability of the code-base.

Doxygen documentation generation is now supported for Enchant (thanks,
Sander van Geloven).

The command-line parsing of the “enchant” program has been made more
friendly and reliable. The -L flag (show line numbers), which had not been
working for some time, has been fixed.

A buffer overflow in personal wordlist handling has been fixed.

Minor improvements were made to the tests (thanks, Sander van Geloven).


2.2.7 (September 9, 2019)
-------------------------

Fix some memory leaks in the hunspell and aspell providers, thanks to an
improvement to the build system to use ASAN for the tests.


2.2.6 (September 5, 2019)
-------------------------

Treat PWL as text, not binary.


2.2.5 (June 30, 2019)
---------------------

Fix a memory leak in the hunspell provider.


2.2.4 (June 17, 2019)
---------------------

Fix a bug in the enchant program, where words ending in non-ASCII characters
were truncated during tokenization.


2.2.3 (February 4, 2018)
------------------------

Fix the previous release’s fix. Sigh.


2.2.2 (February 3, 2018)
------------------------

Fix a bug in the build system where the test harness would try to delete
files under root, typically the system libraries.


2.2.1 (January 3, 2018)
-----------------------

This release fixes a crash on invalid input with the hspell backend, removes
some bashisms from the build system, updates the Free Software Foundation’s
street address, and stops running some tests that fail on recent macOS
(pending a fix).


2.2.0 (December 11, 2017)
-------------------------

This release improves support for parallel installation with other major
versions of Enchant (specifically for man pages), fixes relocation support,
which only partly worked (thanks to Sandro Mani), and makes minor
documentation improvements and fixes a potential crash in the hspell
back-end.


2.1.3 (November 26, 2017)
--------------------------

This release adds support for parallel installation with other major
versions of Enchant, and fixes a crash in the Voikko provider when it has no
supported languages.


2.1.2 (September 28, 2017)
--------------------------

This release adds support for languages other than Finnish to the voikko
provider, from Børre Gaup.


2.1.1 (September 8, 2017)
-------------------------

This release changes no code, but makes the soname of libenchant match the
version number more obviously, as well as changing the way it is calculated
to better match libtool’s versioning rules.


2.1.0 (August 7, 2017)
----------------------

This is a minor feature release. It adds the -word-chars flag to
enchant-lsmod, for a convenient way for other programs to get the extra word
characters for a particular dictionary.

A man page for enchant-lsmod is also now provided.

A little more code cleanup has been done, in particular by upstreaming
gnulib patches.


2.0.0 (August 4, 2017)
----------------------

The major version number has been incremented owing to API/ABI changes, but
in practice upgrading from 1.6.x should be easy.

Previously-deprecated APIs have been removed.

The little-used enchant_broker_get/set_param calls have been removed.

Some trivial API changes have been made to fix otherwise-unavoidable
compilation warnings both in libenchant and in application code. This is
strictly an ABI change (although the ABI may not actually have changed,
depending on the platform).

The provider API has been changed slightly: enchant_get_user_language is now
a documented public API (before it was marked private, but it has in fact
been exported for some years). enchant_get_user_config_dirs is now
enchant_get_user_config_dir, and returns only a single directory.

The plethora of configuration options previously available has been
rationalised and documented. In particular, support for relocation (so that
Enchant, or an application of which it is part, can be installed anywhere in
a filing system) has been rewritten and documented (see INSTALL).

The Myspell backend has been renamed to Hunspell to match the upstream
project. Users with their own enchant.ordering files will need to change
“myspell” to “hunspell”.


1.6.1 (February 6, 2017)
------------------------

Improvements to the enchant-ispell front-end, which is now a working ispell replacement.
Unit tests run on all platforms.
Various bug fixes and code clean-up.
